/**
 * Runtime states.
 *
 * The two TRANSITIONING values are APPENDED, never inserted: the first five are
 * wire-visible (FC 0x46 reports them, and plugin_get_plc_state maps them for
 * vendor status indicators), so renumbering would quietly change what boards
 * report.
 *
 * RUNNING means running -- it is published at the moment the dispatcher is about
 * to release the first scan, not when a start is requested. Everything in
 * between is a TRANSITIONING state, and because both compare unequal to
 * PLC_STATE_RUNNING, every loop that gates on RUNNING treats them correctly
 * without modification: a stop's teardown still gets its exit signal, and a
 * half-started PLC cannot scan.
 *
 * The direction is carried (rather than one flat TRANSITIONING) so that any code
 * found to need the target state before it lands can test for the specific
 * direction instead of having to reintroduce a premature RUNNING.

     * worker bumps `completed` at the end of each scan.

     * `time_at_dispatch` is stamped by the dispatcher at release and applied by
