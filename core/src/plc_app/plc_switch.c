 * @brief Storage for the run/stop mode-switch position.
 *
 * Deliberately tiny: one atomic and three accessors. The runtime never reads
 * hardware and never polls -- a VPP plugin pushes the position whenever it
 * changes, on whatever schedule that package decides (GPIO interrupt, sysfs
 * poll, fieldbus callback, its own thread). The runtime's only use for the
 * value is to refuse a start while the switch reads STOP, and to report the
 * position to the editor.
 *
 * The default is RUN so that a runtime with no switch-aware plugin behaves
 * exactly as it did before this file existed: the boot auto-start is
 * unguarded and every START succeeds.
