         * IEC 61131-3 §6.5.6.1 rule 1 defines a retained value as "the values
         * the variables had when the resource or configuration was stopped",

         * nothing else. The words "download", "reload" and "online change"
         * appear nowhere in Part 3.
         *
         * The check that belongs here already exists one layer up and was
         * built for exactly this: ext_strucpp_retain_unpack() validates magic,
         * format, crc, TRUNCATION and the LAYOUT HASH before a byte reaches a
         * variable, and plc_retain.cpp names which of those failed. STruC++'s
         * own debug-table-gen.ts says why it hashes the layout rather than the
         * program: "a body edit leaves this unchanged and retained values
         * survive, while adding, removing, retyping or reordering a retained
         * variable changes it and the stored blob is refused. The project MD5
         * would have discarded retained state on every unrelated edit."
         *
         * So this gate was not reinforcing that design, it was defeating it —
         * and ModBee's ESP32 store (NodeUioRetain.cpp) keeps the identity for
         * saves and never compares it on read, which is why retain has been
         * seen surviving program changes on real hardware and not here.
         *
         * WHAT IS GIVEN UP, stated plainly for the review: two DIFFERENT
         * projects sharing one retain.bin path whose layout hashes happen to
         * collide would now read each other's values. That is a 32-bit
