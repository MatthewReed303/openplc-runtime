"""VPP device-license debug function codes (0x48/0x49/0x4A), resolved at the
webserver level (D70a).

On runtime-v4 the licensing anchor and the license blob are HOST FILES
(``/proc/device-tree/serial-number`` and ``conf/<plugin>.license``), not plugin
memory, so these function codes are answered here in Python instead of the
realtime C core: it needs no core rebuild, works while the PLC is stopped
(resolves the chicken-and-egg of activating before a program runs), and reuses
the same license-path derivation as the bundle delivery in
``apply_vpp_plugin_conf``.

This lets the editor speak ONE license protocol over any transport (D70c): the
exact Modbus PDU it uses on Arduino, carried by the debug WebSocket. The frame is
raw Modbus PDU (no MBAP, no CRC), byte-identical to the editor's ``modbus-pdu.ts``:

  0x48 get-board-id : req [0x48]                 resp [0x48][status][id_len:u8][id...]
  0x49 write-license: req [0x49][len:u16BE][blob] resp [0x49][status]
  0x4A read-license : req [0x4A]                 resp [0x4A][status][len:u16BE][blob]

Anchor bytes are returned RAW (ASCII, trailing NUL/CR/LF/space stripped) so the
editor derives the SAME device_id the .so does (D70d); no hex-decoding. The
canonical normalization is the C one (``rpi_plugin.c``) because the C is what
decides whether a license verifies -- see ``ANCHOR_STRIP_BYTES`` below.

Blob integrity is checked on BOTH directions (0x49 and 0x4A) with the same
function, mirroring what ``license_store_read`` validates on bare metal so the
two targets answer the same bytes for the same file.

    size -> CORRUPT, magic absent -> EMPTY, crc32 mismatch -> CORRUPT.

    Why this matters on the Linux path specifically: 0x4A used to test the

    another Pi, a corrupted flash, a torn write) answered SUCCESS. The editor

    automatic repair path (recover a fresh license) never ran, precisely because

    Two traps this avoids:

    * A bare ``.startswith(root)`` accepts a sibling that merely shares the
